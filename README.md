# Phylm

Film data aggregation.

## Motivation

When deciding which film to watch next, it can be helpful to have some key datapoints at
your fingertips, for example, the genre, the cast, the Metacritic score and, perhaps
most importantly, the runtime. This package provides a Phylm class to gather information
from various sources for a given film.

## Help

See the [documentation](https://dbatten5.github.io/phylm) for more details.

## Installation

pip install phylm
