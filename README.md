Film data aggregration

## Motivation

When deciding which film to watch next, it can be helpful to have a spreadsheet of data
handy to aid your decision. For example, the genre, the cast, the Metacritic score and,
perhaps most importantly, the runtime. This package receives a csv of movie titles and
returns a spreadsheet of useful information.
